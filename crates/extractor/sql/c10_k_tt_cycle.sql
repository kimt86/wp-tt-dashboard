-- K_TT_CYCLE -- per-truck cycle approximation from MCH_OPERATION (NOT the container
-- handling span). A truck visits a QC once per delivery, so the interval between one
-- trucks consecutive QC moves is approximately one transport cycle (pickup, drive to
-- yard, return, next pickup). Only LD/DS (vessel) moves -- yard moves (MI/MO/LC) are
-- excluded from the headline. Each gap is labelled by the completing move type, so the
-- DS (discharge) and LD (load) cycles are also stored separately. Cap 120..1200s.
-- Type-A template: DAY_STR + TIME_PREDICATE on the completion timestamp (MchOper). LOW.
