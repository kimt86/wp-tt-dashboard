-- Live work pool: individual container moves still to do (JOB_ORDER_LIST is the live
-- twin of JOB_ORDER_HISTORY, but also retains completed rows, so we MUST filter to
-- live). JOBSTATUS: C=Complete A=Active Q=Queued P=Planned B=Blocked. ONE bounded scan
-- pulls BOTH (Oracle-load-conscious): A = dispatched in-flight moves (ETW + assigned
-- TT, the QC task cards); Q = the UNASSIGNED candidate demand (no truck yet). The
-- extractor splits them in Rust — A → live_workpool, Q (aggregated by QC for discharge
-- / by source block for load) → live_candidate. CRE_DT within ~2 days bounds the scan
-- and drops stale orphans.
--
-- NO queue join here: queuenames (e.g. '02D-L') are reused across vessels/voyages over
-- time, so joining JOB_QUEUE_SCHEDULE on (queuename, vessel) fans out against historic
-- queue rows. The QC is attached downstream in Postgres against the clean, current
-- live_workqueue snapshot (unique per vessel+queuename), avoiding the fan-out entirely.
